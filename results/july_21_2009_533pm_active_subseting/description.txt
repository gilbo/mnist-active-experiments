Dotted Lines represent the results with active learning and solid lines represent the results with passive learning.  The top line in green is SVM, the blue is KNN(k=3), and the red is a log-linear multinomial model.

This is mostly the same test as the July 16th 2012 one.  However, instead of scoring the entire available pool of data, we select random sets of K=4 samples and then choose the best from amongst that pool.  We then repeat this selection strategy until we've generated a complete batch.  The diversity and density criteria are not used.

This result demonstrates that by maintaining an element of randomness, we can avoid producing reliably worse results.  This is more encouraging.
